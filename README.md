## Abstract
In today’s fast-paced digital era, users face information overload and lack sufficient time to stay updated with global events. This project proposes an AI-driven platform that automatically collects daily news from reliable sources, summarizes them using Natural Language Processing (NLP), and generates professional-quality news videos through AI-based text-to-speech and virtual news anchor technology. The system personalizes content based on user interests, language preferences, and time availability, and also integrates fake news detection to ensure content credibility. The proposed solution aims to deliver accurate, concise, and engaging daily news briefings in the form of short AI-generated videos.
